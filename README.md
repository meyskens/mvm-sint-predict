# mvm-sint-predict

## Background
Every year Sinterklaas comes from Spain to Moeders Voor Moeders to give toys and candy to the nice children.
Since this is not an easy task to predict how many children will come we use the past data of their family to try to predict this.
The data is exported as CSV out of our Zoho setup then is processed to filter out "frequent clients" and get their family composition.
All data is processed using internal IDs, no names or other identifiable info is ever passed through this system.

You might find the setup weird to be using gRPC, but everything has its reason. Some are just not the right reasons ;)

## Usage
